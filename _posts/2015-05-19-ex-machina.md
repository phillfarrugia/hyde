I just watched [Ex Machina](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752/), a British Sci-Fi film directed by [Alex Garland](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0307497/) and immediately loved it. Not only was it a beautiful film, true to the reasons I love the genre, but it was incredibly thought provoking and different.

Garland depicts a vivid future in which Artificial Intelligence has advanced far beyond where it is today. Distinction between human and machine is present visually but is constantly questioned throughout the film on a strictly theoretical level.

It constantly plays with ideas of human intelligence and creationism yet it also has an underlying element of [gender in its portrayal of the female form](http://www.wired.com/2015/04/ex-machina-turing-bechdel-test/). Positioning of women is somewhat deliberate and representative of many existing present day concerns.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film and it has reignited my love for the Sci-Fi genre. I can't wait to see it again, dig deeper into the ideas Garland addresses and explore them further myself. If you haven't already, make plans to see it. Joshua Topolsky recorded [this great episode](http://pca.st/SKw8) of Tomorrow with Garland about the movie that's also well worth your time.
