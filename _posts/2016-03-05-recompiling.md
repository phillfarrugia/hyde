Over the last 9-10 days I’ve been in Tokyo, Japan attending the first ever Try! Swift conference. Having only received my ticket off the waiting list 4 days before my flight left from Sydney Airport, this was an extremely last minute decision. I was uncertain at first, whether it was an appropriate use of my time, whether I would spend too much money, whether I’d be lost and struggle to fit in with the rest of the community. Oh how wrong I was.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what exactly to take away from the conference. It comes at a time when there is a lot of uncertainty in my life, about what I want, what I need to do next, and how to be where I need to be. This week has stimulated my senses a bit and given me a fresh perspective. In Tokyo, far away from everything that I know and love, I’ve had time to consider my life outside of myself.

What’s next for me comes down to three main things:

- Changing
- Doing
- Learning

*Changing*

I’ve been experimenting with change more recently in my life. Taking things away, moving them around and adjusting everything around me. Moving forward, I will not get comfortable. I will not fall too far into habits. I will not become complacent and will instead be forceful in only placing people around me that can push me into new directions and to learn new things. 

There is no longer any room for ignorant, over-confident, under-experienced and ageist people that lack values or are driven by bullshit like money and success.

I feel that I am currently fighting with every single person in my life about my values. It sucks. It is incredibly hard not to doubt yourself when every one you know tells you that you are wrong. And yet I stand by them. My values are the most important thing in my life, and are the reason why I exist. I have no intention on letting up.   

Last year I let people walk all over me and my values. I let them say things like, “you’re just a junior developer anyway, you are lucky to be on a project that size with those sorts of people”. This year, these people have no room in my life. They are capable of nothing, will achieve nothing and go nowhere.

*Doing*

Up until this point, I feel that I have not really been ‘doing’ the things I deep down want to. The things that I should do if I want to actually contribute something meaningful to the world around me. Moving forward I will do things regardless of fear, regardless of a lack of experience and most importantly regardless of what people might think, say or do. 

I’ve got some plans in the works, and I _will_ do each and every one of them before the year ends. I won’t be bullied into thinking I’m not good enough or capable enough. If I’m not experienced enough, the only way that I am going to become experienced is to try, fail and learn.

I just know that executing on the things that I say I will do, is the key to my being a productive member of society.

*Learning*

Of course, this one will always be on my mind. I’ve admittedly stopped learning lately, and it has been an awful, dark void that has consumed me. I hate it. I hate myself for it. 

I’m putting a stop to this and I will no longer stand still. I will push myself outside of my comfort zone, force myself to do new things and I will keep learning.

If you want to get in my way, and tell me that I’m young and naive. Go and take a look at yourself.
