title: Finding space
---

People can be incredibly opinionated on [Twitter](http://nextshark.com/nilay-patel-apple-watch-review-bracelet-tantrum/) and just in general. I say that because I'm also one of these people. It can be hard to find space to consider thoughts and ideas unless you know the sort of people willing to engage in serious discourse.

There's also the fact that I'm absolutely terrible at conveying my thoughts verbally, in emoji, or within 140 characters or less. Writing is tough but it allows me to focus on and deeply consider an idea that mightn't initially make sense to anyone else.

When I was younger I'd write relatively meaningless words I was passionate about on [Posterous](http://posterous.com/). I'd argue with myself about WikiLeaks and Chelsea Manning, try to convince myself Facebook was destructive and grapple with a philosophical perspective on absolutely anything. I still enjoy being critical and thinking things through. It has since defined the kind of person I've become, the work I love to do and people I know.

Like I did then, I'm setting aside a place on the internet for me to play with ideas, thoughts and questions. I've found there's a sub-concious difference between writing something that nobody will see and writing to yourself publicly. That's where this space fits in and will allow me to think out loud without needing to fit my words into someone else's expectations.

I may write long rants, share code or simply post photos. Either way take anything I say with a grain of salt (unless of course it piques your interest. In which case feel free to share it). Writing is only enjoyable for me if it's focused on an idea that I'm passionate about.

You might enjoy what I have to say if, like me, you're optimistic about the [potential role of technology](http://bilue.com.au/using-the-apple-watch/) in the future but also know how to approach it critically. I tend not to hold a wholly pesimistic view of technology. It seems to always be in abundance  but serves no real purpose.

I should mention that I'm an avid listener of podcasts. At the moment I'm keenly subscribed to [Tomorrow](http://tomorrowpodcast.com), [Roderick On The Line](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/) and [The Partially Examined Life](http://partiallyexaminedlife.com). I have a couple of pages left of [Becoming Steve Jobs](http://becomingstevejobs.com) and as a Philip K. Dick fanatic I've just begun reading [A Scanner Darkly](http://www.amazon.com/Scanner-Darkly-Philip-K-Dick/dp/0547572174).

There are few potential leads for posts in the works, so you should see something soon. Right now I'm thinking about 'affordances in design' or something along the lines of 'optimism and critical thinking'. Not too sure yet.

Thanks for reading
