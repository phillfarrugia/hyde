title: Values

Right now I'm doing what I love.

I'm not here for you or anyone else. Not for money and not for attention. I'm here for me. 
I know too many people than I wish I did that are living and working to make money, to grow for the sake of growing and to achieve a selfish, material, business-focused rather than human-focused ends. This hurts.

In the end I want my actions to be capable of helping others in meaningful ways. I'm not quite there yet but I
can see the beginnings of that pathway. In a way that is probably excessively self-aware, I see myself constantly asking why I am making the decisions I make and too often I don't see people asking why. 

Instead I see the reasons why they once did amazing work begin to slide away, they fall into the traps of a 'career', a 'company', 'growth' and 'success' which to me are nothing more than emotionless, mindless drool. They're wasting time on nonsense and they use their age, status, wealth and respect to perpetuate this throughout the social community around them. You are stuck.

When I was younger I hated the term 'experience' and the meaning that people derive from age. I still think both of these concepts are bullshit. Experience means nothing to me. What are you capable of now? Age means just as little. What are you capable of now? I've learnt a lot of lessons over the past few years, about software, business, products and design but I still hold onto these values strongly.

I'm doing what I love, for the right reasons. I'm going to keep getting better at things, however slowly, but I'm not going to stop fighting against you. You're not the type of person I am, we don't share the same values.
