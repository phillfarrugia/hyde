title: Baffled by Reddit Drama
---

I'm admitting it. I'm completely in any and every way possible baffled by this week's Reddit drama. 

I'm not saying Redditors are good citizens. I'm not saying Redditors are bad citizens. I'm not saying that I'm right or that I'm wrong. I'm just baffled. I can't help it, I'm struggling to understand some of the things I've been reading and I'm trying extremely hard to understand what I'm missing that everyone else seems to be getting.

Following an apology posted by Ellen Pao herself on the site, the New York Times published this article. Which was in reality originally [a completely different article](http://newsdiffs.org/diff/934341/934454/www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/technology/ellen-pao-reddit-chief-executive-resignation.html) that had been edited and replaced by a clearly more critical and agressive perspective of events.

The Daily Beast then published this article addressing some of the personal attacks that occurred in the lead up to Pao's resignation.

I don't understand the justification for the use of the terms 'terrorists', 'worst trolls on the internet', 'hate mob', 'misogynistic' which cast a wide and generic blanket over the entire 'toxic' community surrounding Reddit. 

Responses from Twitter seem to share a similar tone of voice

Many people prefer to use the term 'mysogynistic assholes' to refer to any users of the site. It's baffling. I use Reddit, often. I subscribe to r/news, r/technology, r/science, r/movies, r/philsosophy and a bunch more. I've learnt a lot from the community and continue to. 

*I'm a proud supporter of equal rights across the entire spectrum of society.*

Why does this make me a mysogynist? Why am I now a white supremacist? I'm not comfortable being labeled something I am not.
