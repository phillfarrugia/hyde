title: Taking the high road

Being in control of a situation feels great. You get to look like the smartest guy in the room, take your pick of the witty and ironic tweets to send to all your friends and come out socially unscathed. Being on the right side of the status quo, picking the good fight and saying all the right things. It has become so incredibly easy for people in the technology industry to take sides, to agree, and support a cause simply because it is the safe thing to do. Because it looks to be the right thing to do. People assume that because everyone supports a cause it must be correct, that the powers above have already determined the right from the wrong.

Take any cause, or issue currently under scrutiny in today's society. Gay marriage, freedom of speech, gender equality, anything. Do you support it? Yes? Have you ever asked yourself why? Truly the questions, ethics, values, doubts and experiences that led you to that conclusion and caused you to make an informed logical and confident decision?

Would you be willing to stand up for it against a naysayer and clearly present a justification for your beliefs? Or is it just something that you agree with because it’s what all young people do? Because you don’t want to be the outcast that doesn’t agree with something that everyone else does. If you can’t justify your choice you are doing the rest of those who can a dis-service.

It is better to be wrong and fight for what you believe in than to assume and take sides because it is safe. And that works both ways. Do not act smart, cool and witty on Twitter or anywhere else because you’re on the ‘right’ side of the fence. Be brave enough to stand alone against complacency.

It is so god damn comfortable and easy.

You think you’re better than everyone because you tick all the right boxes? Get real.
