I really enjoy writing words and publishing them on the internet. It's a brilliant way for me to formulate an idea, explore it in depth and materialise it in a physical sense before expressing my thoughts to others. I tend to write a lot for Bilue, about our company, our culture, our daily happenings and anything that seems to come to mind. This is a simple list of my favourite pieces that I'm most proud of -
