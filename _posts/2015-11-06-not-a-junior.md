title: Not a Junior
---

I don't really care about job titles, whether you're a developer, an engineer, a designer, a product manager, a ninja or rockstar. Your job title tells me nothing about who you are, your values, how far you are willing to be pushed or how far you're willing to push yourself.

But I'm a hypocrite and I often do differently than I say.

At my previous job I went from being an Intern to a Junior Developer and for quite a while that was more than enough. I was stoked and could
not have been more proud of what I'd accomplished.

But now I'm working at Bilue, and I've worked with some of the smartest developers I've ever met. And I've crossed
paths with developers that I've looked up to for a very, very long time and some of them are even now friends.

I was recently identified by someone as a Junior Developer, which is a mistake that I can understand anyone would make. I'm a young, small
and relatively childish person to be around. If anyone was to look at me at face value, they wouldn't see how far I've come, so it's understandable.

Now that it has been said, I want to make it as loud and clear as I possibly can.

I am not a Junior Developer.

I'm capable of enough software development to be dangerous.

I have a ridiculously long list of goals I've been delaying for about 3 years. As of last week I am no longer a student. There's no longer any excuse, you should be scared because I intend to get them done.
